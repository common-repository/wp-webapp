WP Webapp allows you to easily add Web App functionality to ANY WordPress Website. 

All you have to do is replace the HOMESCREEN ICON image and the SPLASH SCREEN images included with this plugin. Follow these simple steps to give your WordPress Website Web App functionality!

1. HOMESCREEN ICON
In the "wp-webapp/homeicon/" folder replace the "wp-webapp_icon.png" graphic with YOUR homescreen icon. Your icon MUST be sized (144x144px) and named (wp-webapp_icon.png) EXACTLY the same as the icon it is replacing in that folder.

2. SPLASH SCREENS
In the "wp-webapp/splash/" folder there are splash screen images sized for use on various mobile devices. 

Replace these splash screen images with YOUR images sized and named EXACTLY the same. (If you do not want to use a particular size delete that image from the "images" folder). 

Sizes are as follows:
iPhone 3: 320x460px
iPhone 4: 640x920px
iPhone 5: 640x1096px
Landscape Tablets: 748x1024
Portrait Tablets: 768x1004
Landscape Retina Tablets: 1496x2048
Portrait Retina Tablets: 1536x2008

NOTE: All image names are CASE SENSITIVE. Images must be NAMED and SIZED exactly the same to work.
